# Introduction
This project is about sales.
* Sales are transactions between two or more parties in which the buyer receives tangible or intangible goods, services, or assets in exchange for money. In some cases, other assets are paid to a seller.
* This project aims to improve sales performance by streamlining the project delivery, research, target selection, tracking, and reporting of physical goods or services.
* Sales project activities help to reduce redundancies, streamline sales operations, make sales efforts more predictable, and offer sales leadership better visibility into how their teams and broader organizations are operating and also helps the management of a particular organization get detailed insights about how well revenue making can be increased and how some cost can be cut off if need be.

## Tools
* SQL
* Tableau
  
## Steps taken to make this project a success 
* Data Collection: Gathering relevant sales data from various sources, such as point-of-sale systems, customer databases, and online platforms.
* Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensuring the data is accurate and consistent by removing duplicates, correcting errors, handling missing values, and organizing it for analysis using SQL.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using statistical and visualization techniques to gain initial insights into the data, such as identifying top-selling products, sales trends, and customer orders using Tableau.
* Performance Metrics: Defining key performance indicators (KPIs) like sales growth, customer acquisition, and retention rates to measure the success of the sales efforts.
* Visualization: Creating clear and compelling visualizations in tools like Tableau to communicate findings and insights to stakeholders.
* Recommendations: Drawing actionable insights from the analysis and suggesting strategies for improving sales, pricing, marketing, and inventory management.
